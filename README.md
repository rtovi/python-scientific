# ðŸ“Ÿ  Python Scientific 

Nowadays, python is ruling the world.  This very humble language that was once the realm of enlighted developers that loved to create the most beautiful scripting language is now becoming the programming language of the world, and particularly of the data deluge.

This repository allows you to install all the necesary stuff to start working with python on scientific applications, and particularly, to work with sensor data and neuroscience time-series.  It allows you to install everything you need and start coding with NumPy, SciPy, OpenAI and MNE.

If you don't know anything at all about python, and you want to know something that will help you to do what you need, this is one place to be.

## Contents

* ðŸ”ª Python Introduction
* ðŸ“¥ Workspace Setup
* ðŸ“ˆ Signal Processing Overview
* ðŸ”Ž Signal Analysis and Feature Extraction
* ðŸ›  Python ML/DL Tools and Techniques
* ðŸ§  Neurodata Processing


## Procedure

* Install Git Bash
  https://git-scm.com/downloads
  
* Install Anaconda

  Download Anaconda 3.7 for your platform and install it.
  https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
 
 * Install Visual Studio Code
 
  Download and install it from https://code.visualstudio.com/download
  
 * Clone this repository
 
  From the Git Bash console, run
  
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/faturita/python-scientific.git
 ```
 
 * Run an Anaconda Prompt
 * Move with "cd" to the directory that you just downloaded ("cd python-scientific")
 * Create the environment with:
 
 ```bash 
 conda env update --name mne3 --file config/environmentw.yml
 ```

 (or this one if any error occurs
 
 ```
 conda env update --prefix ./env --file config/environmentw.yml 
 ```

 )
 
 * Activate the newly created environment
 ```bash
 conda activate mne3
 ```

NOTE: if you receive an error about 'umap package missing' or similar, just ''edit'' your local file [environmentw.yaml](config/environmentw.yml) and erase the umap line from the file.  You can later install this package directly from an Anaconda prompt by doing:

 ```bash
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
 ```

 * Install umap (or any package that you want)
 ```bash
 conda install -n mne3 umap
 ```

Ã³

 ```bash
 conda install -n mne3 umap-learn
 ```

# How to update your own repository with new changes from the server repository ?
  
  Run gitbash (windows) or start a new Console on Mac or Linux.

  First you need to upload your own changes to your OWN repository.
  
  ```bash
  git commit -m"Just write down whatever comes to your mind here" .
  ```
  
  After that you need to PULL fresh changes from the server repository at github.
  
  ```bash
  git pull origin master
  ```
  
  If you have happened to modify a file, the previous command will trigger an automatic merge.  If the merge is successful it will open a VI console (just press ':' and 'x') to add a merging comment.
  If there is any conflict, check the modified files looking for any sign of conflict (you will clearly notice it).  After you fix the merging, mark it as resolved with 'git add filename' and finish the operation with 'git commit -m"Merge fixed"'
